Output module.
This module handles the output of data to all possible solutions.
It is designed to primarily handle CSV and REST API but can be adapted.

    This function searches through open_files to see if a file has

    If the file is not found to be open, it is opened and the CSV
    headers are written to the top of the file, then it's added to the
